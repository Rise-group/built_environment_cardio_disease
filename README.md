## Abstract:
This study examines the relationships between the built environment and mortality risk from chronic heart and metabolic diseases in Medellín, Colombia. Much of the previous research has concentrated on the effects of specific built environment features on chronic diseases in high income countries. We extend this body of work by leveraging the official health statistical records to conduct an ecological study on the health impacts of multiple built environment features in the Colombian context. We analyze four disease groups: diseases of the circulatory system, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. Results indicate that urban design elements, such as intersection density, were associated with lower mortality rates from heart diseases and diabetes. The average slope in the neighborhood was positively associated with the mortality rates of all four disease groups. A greater amount of green spaces was associated with lower mortality of all cardiovascular diseases. We found some evidence of curvilinear relationships regarding intersection density, density of amenities, and residential density. This evidence indicates that the intersection density in Medellín neighborhoods starts to relate negatively with the mortality rates after surpassing 150 to 200 intersections by square-kilometer, while the density of amenities and the population density show the inverse effect: they are good up to a different threshold in each case and after surpassing them the association changes. Local urban planners and policymakers should strike a good balance between intersection density, the density of amenities, and residential density. Our findings add to the previous literature from high income countries that built environment features are important contributors to cardiovascular and metabolic health in Colombia. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm these findings.

This repository contains the spatial dataset and code use for the econometric analysis of the corrected version of the paper *Built environment and mortality risk from cardiovascular disease and diabetes in Medellin, Colombia: an ecological study.* The paper was submitted to the journal Landscape and Urban Planning (manuscript number: LAND_2020_1272).
