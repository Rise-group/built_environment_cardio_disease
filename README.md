### Abstract 

This paper examines the linkages between built environment and chronic heart disease in Medell√≠n, Colombia, at intra-urban level.  While most of the literature has concentrated on the effects of some features of the built environment on chronic heart disease in cities from developed countries, this paper seeks to assess whether those findings stand in a Colombian city.
